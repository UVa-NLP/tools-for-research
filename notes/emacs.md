# Emacs

Yangfeng's favorite text editor. With some extensions, it can do anything for you. Here are some examples

- [AucTex](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/): for writing and formatting TeX
- [Markdown-mode](https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/): for editing Markdown-formatted text

[Here](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs) is a long list of Emacs extensions.
